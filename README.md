# 🚀 End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline on AWS

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a fully automated end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and modern DevOps tools. The goal of this project is to automate the application delivery process from code commit to deployment, ensuring faster, reliable, and repeatable software releases.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Jenkins
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Git & GitHub
- Linux (Ubuntu)

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Workflow
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub  
2. Jenkins pipeline is triggered automatically  
3. Jenkins pulls the latest code and builds the application  
4. Docker image is created and pushed to a container registry  
5. Kubernetes deploys the application on AWS infrastructure  
6. Application runs with automated deployment and scalability  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Fully automated CI/CD pipeline  
- Docker-based containerization  
- Kubernetes deployment and management  
- Cloud-based infrastructure using AWS  
- Reduced manual deployment effort  
- Real-world DevOps workflow implementation  

---

## ▶️ How It Works
- Any code change pushed to GitHub automatically triggers the Jenkins pipeline.
- Jenkins handles the build and Docker image creation.
- The Docker image is stored in a container registry.
- Kubernetes pulls the image and deploys the application.

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding CI/CD pipeline concepts  
- Hands-on experience with AWS cloud services  
- Practical exposure to Docker and Kubernetes  
- Experience with deployment automation  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project simulates a real-world DevOps environment and demonstrates how CI/CD automation, containerization, and cloud infrastructure work together to deliver applications efficiently and reliably.
